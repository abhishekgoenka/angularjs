# AngularJS Boilerplate
The boilerplate code for AngularJS.  You can use it to quickly bootstrap your angular webapp projects and dev environment for these projects.

# Getting Started
We have preconfigured npm to automatically run bower so we can simply do:
> npm install

Behind the scenes this will also call bower install. After that, you should find out that you have two new folders in your project.
1. node_modules
2. app/bower_components

# Run the Application
>  npm start
